# DailyUI Challenge - A Calculator

I know; another calculator project.

Since this is fairly straight-forward stuff, I'm keeping it interesting by touching on TypeScript again. In my opinion, while there is a bit of a learning curve to TypeScript, it results in an easily maintainable codebase wherein bugs are less frequent. Applying strict-typing is an immensely useful thing when navigating the (sometimes) Wild West quirks of JavaScript.

Besides for practicing TypeScript, this is a project to practice design.

## The Challenge

> Design a calculator. Standard, scientific, or specialty calculator for something such as a mortgage? Is it for a phone, a tablet, a web app?

## Objectives

- TODO: Make a simple calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential, and root functionality) with TDD, written TypeScript, and Jest.

- TODO: Create an interface through HTML to provide client-facing functionality.

- TODO: Decide on a niche market to orient the design, and provide additional functionality.
